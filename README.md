### Keyboard's shortcuts (LINUX)

#### Sublime Text
```ruby

move a line upwards in file                # ctrl + shift + ↑
move a line downwards in file              # ctrl + shift + ↓
(un)comment lines                          # ctrl + shift + :
search in file                             # ctrl + f
search in project                          # ctrl + shift + f
add package                                # ctrl + shift + p
add indentation                            # tab
remove indentation                         # shift + tab
move text cursor to next word              # alt + →

delete a line                              # ctrl + shift + k
duplicate a line                           # ctrl + shift + d
```

#### Terminal
```ruby
open a new tab                             # ctrl + shift + t
close tab                                  # ctrl + shift + w
clear window                               # ctrl + L (or type "clear" in terminal)
```

### Conflicts solving
When you can't merge a PR due to conflicts in an `unmergeable_branch`, follow this process:

```ruby
# go to your local master branch
git checkout master

# update your master branch locally with github's master
git pull origin master

# go back to unmergeable_branch
git checkout unmergeable_branch

# merger master in unmergeable branch to solve conflicts locally
git merge master

# now you've fetched all conflicts locally, time to solve them
# open sublime and solve conflicts (locate them with cmd + shift + f <<<<<<<)

# commit your code
git add .
git commit -m "conflict solving"
git push origin unmergeable_branch

# open your PR on github to merge it
hub browse

# merge your PR on github

# go back to your terminal and update your local master with merged files
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# create a new branch for next feature
git checkout -b next_feature
```
